# Job apply form

This is a fictional form for web developers who want to find a tech job. It is a playground for adding and styling multiple form related elements. Also, using the advanced attribute selectors.

- **Third form: A form for collecting education and experience level: Highest form of education dropdown, Level of expertise dropdown, Years of experience radio button, Kind of web developer radio button.** // NEXT

- Forth form: A form for collecting skills. A number of checkboxes with all possible skills, tools, and programming languages. Maybe add a range button to select the level of expertise in each of them? TBD

- To be continued...
